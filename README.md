# EncourageBot
This is a python based discord chatbot.
The bot replies to specific words/phrases in the server messages that are sent by others (not those sent by the bot itself).
The bot replies are either:
- random inspirational quotes with their authors (generated from a separate web API) 
- a random cheer up message selected from a list that discord users might be able to update (add more messages to it)
